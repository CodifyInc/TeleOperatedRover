# TeleOperatedRover

Project video and tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcaPVJwRSpw

Here are the instructions for building a gesture controlled rover (tele operated rover). It consists of a rover unit which has a collision avoidance sensor onboard. The transmitter instead of being a clumsy remote is a cool glove which can be worn on the hand and then moved to transmit signals to the rover using hand movements. RF signals are used for communication.

This project has potential applications in vehicle underbody inspection (for security or maintenance) besides being eventually used to fly drones.

Supplies required:
	1. Arduino/Genuino UNO (with UNO cable) x2 \n
	2. Li-ion Battery (12V) x1
	3. Jumper Wires (Male to male, male to female, female to female) x40 each
	4. Breadboard x1
	5. L298 Motor Driver Module x1
	6. MPU6050 Gyroscope x1
	7. RF Receiver and Transmitter x1 each
	8. Ultrasonic Sensor x1
	9. Chassis setup x1
	10. Battery Holder (often included with chassis) x1
	11. Switch (often included with chassis) x2
	12. Wire Stripper x1
	13. De-soldering Pump (not necessary) x1
	14. Double Sided Tape x1

Preparing the Arduino IDE:
	1. Download and link the VirtualWire library: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F_sQFRT4lsN5dUKXJdckl21weMJFzy1P/view?usp=sharing
	2. Upload receiver_project_night_Analog_rovervideo.ino to the Arduino on the rover
	3. Upload transmitter_code_rovervideo.ino to the Arduino on the glove
